# Technology-Used

- To build this project I utilized the mySQL database to build the employees, roles, and departments table and then used npm inquirer and npm console table from n=Node.js to take input from the user and display the desired results.

# User-Story

- First the user must install mySQL, create the database using the provided schema and populating it with the seeds file. 

- Second make sure to open the integrated terminal and run npm install to get all the required packages and dependencies. 

- Once everything is properly set up the user can run 'node server.js' in the terminal to begin the application. 

- There they will be presented with a list of options to choose from and interact with the database in various ways. 

- PROVIDED OPTIONS:
    - View All Employees 
    - View All Departments
    - View All Roles
    - View All Managers
    - Add Employee  *(UNDER DEVELOPMENT)*
    - Remove Employee *(UNDER DEVELOPMENT)*
    - Update Employee Role *(UNDER DEVELOPMENT)*
    - Update Employee Manager *(UNDER DEVELOPMENT)*
    - EXIT

- Each options should perform the described function and once the user is done interacting with the Employee Tracker database they can end the application by pressing 'EXIT.'

# Conclusion

- Overall this assignment has been a real challenge. I feel like I have a decent understanding of using Node.js and building a mySQL database. I've just had a hard time with putting it all together in the end. If I had more time on this project I think I could complete all the functions and make it all work. But with the nature of the Bootcamp I need to keep moving forward and start the next project. I will definitely be reviewing this assignment in hopes of finishing it soon!
